career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Most comfortable when tackling problems with new ideas. Lots of time spent optimizing workflows using CAD (Plant 3D, CADWorx) and HDS (Leica Cyclone), and building potent automation (Python, SQL, .NET) that smashes bottlenecks in specs, isometrics, and data validation.

    Plenty of time in the drivers seat, driving projects end-to-end. From strategic planning to hands-on coding and technical leadership, it's my endeavor to explore cutting-edge tech (AI, web viz) to revolutionize engineering processes. Ready for the next big challenge!
